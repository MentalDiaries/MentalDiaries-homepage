Problem Statement Analysis
----------------------------
For the past two years, the COVID-19 Pandemic has drastically changed ourlives and made it monotonous by restricting us to our homes. This has had an adverse affect
on the mental health of children, thus there is a pressing need for better surveillance tools to identify cases of mental health issues among children, both congenital
and acquired so that proper counselling can be provided to them without any delay.

Our Solution
----------------------------
1) We have developed an Artificial Intelligence based tool through which user can main a daily diary about their emotions and how they are feeling. This text input will 
be directed to the backend where it will be fed to the ML-AI model. Then a daily probability of each day as well as a cumulative progressive analysis will be displayed
to help user track their progress.
