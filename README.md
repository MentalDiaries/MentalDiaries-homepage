Problem Statement Analysis
----------------------------
For the past two years, the COVID-19 Pandemic has drastically changed ourlives and made it monotonous by restricting us to our homes. This has had an adverse affect
on the mental health of children, thus there is a pressing need for better surveillance tools to identify cases of mental health issues among children, both congenital and acquired so that proper counselling can be provided to them without any delay. Since mental health awareness is not widespread in India, people fail
to address this problem, thus, this tool will provide an excellent way to self-analyse their mental health.

Our Solution
----------------------------
1) We have developed an Artificial Intelligence based tool through which user can main a daily diary about their emotions and how they are feeling. This text input will be directed to the backend where it will be fed to the ML-AI model. Then a daily probability of each day as well as a cumulative progressive analysis will be displayed to help users track their progress. User will also be able to maintain a record of all the posts in a diary.
2) Parents and teachers can also log information about the behavioral pattern and personality disorders of the child to get a progressive analysis about the mental health of the child in form of charts along with regular status updates.
3) Based on the analysis, alerts and recommendations of nearby mental health consultants and therapists will be provided to the user using Geo-location API. This will assist them to book appointments and get adequate counselling.
4) Given the fact that mental health is a very personal topic, we don't ask for the identity of the user during signup inorder to maintain the anonymity of the user. They just have to provide their username and password.
